# Agentic-AKM CORE

Agentic-AKM CORE is the foundational toolchain of the Agentic-AKM research initiative. It explores how humans and software agents can co-design, build, and evolve complex software systems by codifying good engineering practices into enforceable rules and lifecycles.

## Status & Scope

- **Active construction**: Interfaces, contracts, and behaviors change frequently. Expect breaking changes and undocumented gaps.
- **Use at your own risk**: The project is published early to invite feedback from practitioners interested in human–agent collaboration patterns.
- **Research artifact**: Outcomes that emerge here are intended to spark discussion and inspire derivative experimentation rather than provide production-grade guarantees.

## Goals

1. Define a repeatable structure for agent-augmented software programs that keeps humans in-the-loop for critical decisions.
2. Capture architecture and knowledge artifacts so agents can reference, extend, and challenge them across the software lifecycle.
3. Encode best practices from software engineering into explicit rules, guardrails, and workflows that guide both humans and agents.

## How to Engage

1. **Clone and explore**: Review the evolving structure, conventions, and lifecycle definitions. Expect rough edges.
2. **Experiment carefully**: Apply the rules in sandbox projects to understand how agent guidance shapes architecture decisions.
3. **Share insights**: Open issues or discussions describing what worked, what failed, and where tighter rules or tooling would help.

## Research Lineage

Agentic-AKM is an independent, self-funded research effort. The rationale, background notes, and broader documentation that motivate this core repository live at [agentic-akm.com](https://agentic-akm.com). Contributions—conceptual or technical—should reference those materials to keep the research thread coherent.
